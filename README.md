# django-fact-checker

An example Django project for collecting, editing and publishing fact check checks, as defined in [Google's structured data guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/factcheck).

Inspired by [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/) and the other imitable members of the [International Fact-Checking Network](https://www.poynter.org/international-fact-checking-network-fact-checkers-code-principles).

Built in the RJI Future Lab.
